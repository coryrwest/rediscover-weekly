# rediscover-weekly
Rediscover your music (inspired by Spotify's Discover Weekly)


## How it works
Rediscover Weekly will generate a playlist every week of songs that you like and include a random subset of songs that you haven't listened to in order to create a playlist that you will enjoy as well as help you rediscover your music.

Rediscover weekly uses Subsonic to both track your play counts and build the playlist for listening.

## Prerequisites
 - A Last.fm account (used for play counts)
 - A subsonic instance
 - Postgresql (hopefully support SQLite)

## Future Features
 - Configurable randomness
 - Configurable playlist length
 - Take play counts into account instead of just checking that they aren't 0
 - Better song matching
 - SQLite support
 - MySQL support
 - Google Play support?
